## To-do list

- Eliminate `first_exists_if_follow_changes`
- About `first_unioncharset`: does the outcome depend on the boolean return value?
- Define a functional version of  `first` and its equivalence to the inductive definition
- Think the case for the and-predicate patterns `&P` in the definition of first in C: can we make the case for the not-predicate pattern `!P` stronger?
  Is there something that first can return and make the definition more informative?
